## 💬 News
**[2023/04/09]**: Update the DIOR_RSVG dataset. (to clarify, we have been planning to continuously optimize this dataset, and the last public version was wrong and has now been restored.)
**[2022/11/07]**: Release the DIOR_RSVG dataset.  
**[2022/10/22]**: Release the training code. Publish the manuscript on arXiv.


## Introduction
This is Multi-Granularity Visual Language Fusion (MGVLF) Network, the PyTorch source code of the paper "RSVG: Exploring Data and Model for Visual Grounding on Remote Sensing Data". It is built on top of the [TransVG](https://github.com/djiajunustc/TransVG) in PyTorch. Our method is a transformer-based method for visual grounding for remote sensing data (RSVG). It has achieved the SOTA performance in the RSVG task on our constructed RSVG dataset.

## Requirements and Installation
We recommended the following dependencies.
- Python 3.6.13
- PyTorch 1.9.0
- NumPy 1.19.2
- cuda 11.1
- opencv 4.5.5
- torchvision

## Download Data
Download our constructed RSVG dataset files. We build the first large-scale dataset for RSVG, termed DIOR-RSVG, which can be downloaded from our [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hTqtYsC6B-m4ED2ewx5oKuYZV13EoJp_?usp=sharing). The download link is available below:
```

```

## Training and Evaluation
```
python main.py
```

Run ```main.py``` using ```--test False``` to train new models on DIOR-RSVG.
Evaluate trained models on DIOR-RSVG using ```--test True```.
